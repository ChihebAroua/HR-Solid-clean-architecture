Hello ,
in this repo we're going to look at the solid principles and how we can apply them to a cleanly architected application.
In ASP.NET Core, we're also going to explore advanced concepts like the CQRS and mediator patterns, fluent validations and global exception handling and logging.
We're also going to look at unit and integration testing, API and Blazar development.
The general concept of clean architecture begins at the core, and this is described as the application core where we define our entities and interfaces.
Then around the core, we have the infrastructure layer, we have the API layer, we have our unit tests and we have our UI.
We're going to do a deep dive into all of these layers as we go along.
